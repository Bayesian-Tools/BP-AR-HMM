# BP-AR-HMM
Straight port (to python) of Emily Fox's Beta Process Auto Regressive 
Hidden Markov Model package.

The plan is to make this modular so that both MCMC and SVI would be 
available for inference.  Also, I would like to make this run on spark 
(so a distributed inference scheme will be required to be implemented 
soon)
